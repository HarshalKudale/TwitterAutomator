### Installation
Step 1: Download the Extension

    Extract the contents of the ZIP archive to a folder on your computer. This folder will contain all the necessary files for the extension.

    In the "Extensions" page, you'll see a "Developer mode" toggle switch at the top right. Enable it by clicking the switch to turn it on.

Step 6: Load the Unpacked Extension

    After enabling developer mode, you'll see three new buttons: "Load unpacked," "Pack extension," and "Update."

    Click the "Load unpacked" button. A file dialog will open.

    Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files in Step 2, select the folder, and click "Open."
